        <h2>SCI-FI IN AN EXTREMELY LONG RANT FINALLYYYYYYYYYYY</h2>
    <p>
        Okay, should I start with characters, overarching stories, short stories, short stories that are at least a few hours read but still considered short, maybe just descriptions and interviews? There's so much to talk about in stories alone, but we can also talk about the site itself, maybe even some drama if you'd like? No, no drama it's not ever school appropriate when people get in trouble on that site, but we can refer to it in ways that can let it be inferred, probably maybe idk. If you wanna hear me complain about some things too, I'd love to, or I can just talk about some of the things I adore. I can mention the history of the site as far as I know it, which isn't much like at all. Maybe I can discuss why a show/movie/series will never happen unless a lot of people are willing to use up money on it, or we disfigure capitalism. Personally, I'm a firm believer in the second choice, but that's not really supposed to be discussed here. Ohh first things's first, right, got it, understood, will get to it, yep, mhm, mhm, alright one second. Don't worry I'm still <strong>very</strong> excited for this long rant. (Not being sarcastic)

        <h2>The Premise</h2>
    <p>
        Alright, let's do this one last time; The SCP Foundation is a fictional organization which contains & studies anomalous beings, artifacts, events, etc. Although sometimes a baseline "canon" may be referred to, there is none. Different stories have different canons that all are made to fit the story, and this extends to any GoI(Group of Interest) mentioned. Not to be mistaken with "Do whatever just use the title" as there are standards, and consistenly recurring themes. So to break it down: Each SCP story has a required head to use, and the rest of the entire body is as the writer pleases. Do you want the Foundation to be hundreds of years old? Done. Just a decade or so? Done. Is the Foundation extremely very strict about how it works, their motto, and their actions? Only if you need it to be that strict, but don't get it too different the site has rules too and the Foundation has standards. I could go on about what's flexible, or you can do that yourself. 
        <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/guide-for-newcomers">Guide for newcomers, and I hope you get a handle of the site quickly</a> 
        Alright, so you got the premise. What now, you ask? Ask so I can continue. Thank you. Well now I give you some stuff to remember if you decide to read from there. <strong>Note from future me, I might not even talk about the stories. Ignore the link if you wanna, cause this is gonna be my personal guide from me to you.</strong>

        <h1>A Guide to The Foundation, from Ferris - A barely-below-mid-level reader of the wiki.</h1>

    <br>

        <h2><small>a few</small>  Groups of Interest (GoI)</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>There are TONS of GoI, so allow me to list the ones you'll hear about most.</li>

                                                     picture of GOC

        <li>The Global Occult Coalition (GOC): These guys are usually on neutral terms with the Foundation, but have a wildly different goal -- The destruction of all things anomalous. I kid you not this is their actual mostly-canon history of formation: After WW2 had ended numerous occultists, psychics, priests, and scientists had defected from Nazi, Soviet, and Allied states. The Allies of these defectors had formed the GOC, and eventually numerous governments started to join until it became as big as it is. The GOC is on par with the Foundation as of current, and for this reason they leave each other mostly alone. These people do not just destroy anomalous creatures, but anything anomalous. They are (sometimes, of course) willing to use anomalous things that side with them for their purposes, as long as said thing is reliable. Example given later. In case the point wasn't made clear enough, they terminate anomalous humans too. Healers, magic users, especially reality benders, etc. Just because they're big, doesn't mean they're always on point, and obviously these stand-ins for bigots are problem makers. Both of these traits are pointed out in the story of SCP-1609.</li>

                                                     picture of CI

        <li>The Chaos Insurgency (CI): Honestly, these guys are pretty decently covered in mystery. Like, I just read their brief explanation of their history over in the GoI section of the wiki, and learned like 3-5 new things despite how beloved these guys are. Now, if you want to know if the Foundation has an antagonist, here you are. The CI was formed after a (number of) Foundation staff member(s) went A.W.O.L. The leader, known as The Engineer, is shrouded in mystery, but is known to have a too-big amount of knowledge on the innerworkings of the Foundation and how to counter them. Apparently these guys are very authoritarian, and literally take over small countries so they can do experiments. I didn't know either of those 3 things until like 10 minutes ago. The CI will raid Foundations, <strong>steal</strong> SCP's, and after that kinda return to secrecy with what they use the SCP's for. They do use SCP's for raiding Foundations sometimes, but honestly these guys seem like intentionally easy for writing with. An antagonist shrouded in mystery with knowledge of innerworkings, at least a few small countries worth of people, SCP's as weapons, etc. sounds like real easy to write about. I can think of a  few ways to make these guys useful in a story already.</li>

                                                    picture of Serpent's Hand (Not abbreviating.)

        <li>THE SERPENT'S HAND UGH I NEED TO READ MORE ABOUT THEM (No, I'm not using the SH abbreviation. You shouldn't either.): The Serpent's Hand is also a very loose group you can kinda easily write about, at least I think so when I say that phrase. Their goal is to integrate the world with anomalies, something I agree with. Believe it or not, these fellas also tend to have anomalous members. Who would've guessed? The only place that members can consistenly call their "base" is <a href="https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/" alt="Link to The Wanderer's Library">The Wanderer's Library</a>, which I'll talk about as the next GoI even though it's a location not a group. The reason for this being their "base" is because even though they're big and powerful, they're not actually an official group. The only requirement to join is to say you're a member, and y'know mean it and agree with the beliefs and stuff but that's obvious. Members tend to be on bad terms with numerous different groups. Like, every that you'll hear of. They tolerate the Foundation, hate the GOC, usually on bad terms with the CI, etc.</li>

                                                    picture of https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/

        <li>Okay, I said it already, and am saying it again. The Wanderers Library is <em>not</em> a group, although of interest. The Library is an interdimensional location of unknown size and origin. The size is unknown for obvious reasons. It's massive. The shelves go up way past the clouds, it can take a week+ to find the main desk, etc. Some notable rules of the library are the no violence rule, and returning books on time. An overusage of violence can get not just your affiliates banned, but your universe. Refusing to follow basic library rules can result in the punishment of being turned into an employee until your tab is paid off. I plan on reading from stories in this wiki; which, fun fact, is the <strong>only</strong> official sister-site of the SCP-wiki. The main goal of stories written for the library is to invoke a feeling of wonder in readers, and that honestly just sounds so innocent I wanna read some but ughhh procrastination demons. Wait it's that damn rock. (For context read SCP-___-J)</li>

                                                scarlet king

        <li>The Children of The Scarlet King (you know how to abbreviate atp): A cult revolving around the Scarlet King. Multiverse satan. that's who he is. I used to be quite interested but upon reading the story about him, I realized this is just like the evil incarnate guy. and he's not even that strong I heard there's a story where he's just like jumped by a bunch of normal guys and some anomalies too. He's been noted throughout history in several cultures, all of which use the same terms to refer to him: Something that means red, and whatever is closest to meaning royalty. Crimson Lord, Blood Royal or something else, you get it. In The Court of The Crimson Kiiiiinggggggggggg. I'm keeping that line in. Honestly, just read Zalgo dude. Go on the creepypasta.com site and read Zalgo.</li>

    </ul>

    <br>

        <h2>(General) Ranks of Order</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Administrator - Top of the top of the top. Literally. Created the place, and context of him/her/it/   can be changed, except shrouded in mystery.</li>

        <li>The O5 (Overseer) council - Usually the top of the top. Very mysterious and thus flexible. Usually 13 members, or well 13 numbers. Apparently in some canons multiple people share the number. They may be human, or just be humanoids. They do have anomalous effects as well, that's consistent, but a story can remove that. Sometimes the numbers are a rank of personal order inside the council. You get it, very flexible and mysterious. The 5 in their group name comes from their security level which I'll also get into. Only they may have Level 5 keycards.</li>

        <li>Ethics Committee - Alright, I know, I know. "Dude, this is a division of the Foundation, not a rank." I knowwwwwwuh, buuuut the Head of the Ethics Committee can sometimes be on par with the O5, and the division itself tends to be on par with the O5, as can be inferred by the fact that both groups have their own personal MTF Groups (We'll get into them later but imagine security for these fellas) so these guys count as much as the O5 does.</li>

        <li>Heads of a Division - Come on, there's not much here. Level 4 people who don't need much explanation, you've worked and seen movies of needed delegated jobs before. I think they tend to be on par with Heads of projects and MTF Squad leaders though, but idk I don't work there. <small>as far as you know..</small></li>

        <li>Level 3 staff - Seniors. I'm gonna keep going on the ranks of order, but gonna explain only as needed.</li>

        <li>Level 2 staff - Honestly, I'd mix this with level 1 staff for a short wrap-up but noooo I need to do something else with level 1. Most staff will be this rank.</li>

        <li>Level 1 staff - Newbies, obviously. I know you see what level is after this, so you're asking "Why are these guys newbies if there's a lesser level?" Probably asking. Ask. Now. Thank you. Level 1 staff are not just the newbies, but recurring miscellaneous staff too. A newbie is on the same level as a trusted janitor, despite whatever "big" project a Level 1 is working on.</li>

        <li>Level 0 staff, yes this is an actual level. - Miscellaneous staff. Usually amnesticized after they're done doing whatever they're here for. I mean there for.</li>

    </ul>

    <br>

        <h2>Names (and Numbers) to Remember.</h2>

    <ul>
        <p>"Another list? Aww come onnnn boo bear." Yes, I know, another don't call me that. Yes, another list, you'll probably thank me.</p>

        <li>Let's start with staff/perssonnel - why not start with my favorite character? I said we're starting with my favorite and you're gonna listen. A level 4 member, currently head of the division of training and development, Director (I just learned the Dr. stands for director not doctor, but assumed it meant doctor cause y'know normally it does.) Alto Clef. "Alto Clef" is not its real name, and it insists its real name is the A Major chord on a Ukelele, and carries a ukelele around in case any creatures that can produce this noise want to call it by name. Although I just referred to him as it, it is a him, but it works as well if you wanna drill in the soullessness the foundation asks of you. He's normally depicted with blonde hair but has no described hair color, he's described to have a sizeable nose, a smile like a cheshire cat, 3 eyes of differing colors (blue, green, and hazel), an inability to be captured by any means of photography, given his nickname for both the human inability to pronounce his real name and his consistent use of the alto clef symbol to sign off on paper work, and nobody likes him because he's a pathological liar in anything non-SCP related, innapropriate in every manner of the word, smells, does weird things for no reason, does innapropriate things for little reasons without warning, and more. He's kept around though for his skills that are just barely worth the pain that he is; Skills such as: Proficiency in any weapon needed, proficiency in swiftly eliminating threats, proficiency in driving any type of vehicle used for militaristic purposes, and potentially the best there is at eliminating reality-benders aka "Type Greens". He was officially recognized for all of these skills when he was in the GOC (Global Occult Coalition) and this is the example I was talking about back then. Alto Clef is a reality-bender who uses his abilities to negate other reality manipulations as best he can for the sake of terminating them. His nickname in the GOC was "Agent Ukelele". There's only one note made for readers about him which reads as follows, "Under no circumstances is Alto Clef to consume an entire tin of Altoids mints."</li>

        <li>bright. we hate him. he's a self insert for the horrible person who made him. sometimes his character is named shaw because some people like him. imagine Deadpool, but worse. now make him worse again. and again. and one more time. quite literally, i cannot talk about what its creator did in a school setting, but it involved minors. the Wiki is still figuring out what they want to do with the character (Who had existed for a decade+ at this point), and everything the creator made, 4 years after the creator was finally outted. if you see an apologist for the character, ignore them, or contact me so i can describe to them in detail what the creator did and how the character is linked to him in an inevitable way. i mourn the character that could've been, but i've been in easing through the acceptance stage for a while now. he was part of my childhood man.</li>

        <li>WHEW back to the bright(er) side of the fandom, let's get to talking about Konny!! Benjamin Kondraki! I really need to stop procrastinating, I've been wanting to read about this guy for a while noww ughhhh. </li>
