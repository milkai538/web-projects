        <h2>SCI-FI IN AN EXTREMELY LONG RANT FINALLYYYYYYYYYYY</h2>
    <p>
        Okay, should I start with characters, overarching stories, short stories, short stories that are at least a few hours read but still considered short, maybe just descriptions and interviews? There's so much to talk about in stories alone, but we can also talk about the site itself, maybe even some drama if you'd like? No, no drama it's not ever school appropriate when people get in trouble on that site, but we can refer to it in ways that can let it be inferred, probably maybe idk. If you wanna hear me complain about some things too, I'd love to, or I can just talk about some of the things I adore. I can mention the history of the site as far as I know it, which isn't much like at all. Maybe I can discuss why a show/movie/series will never happen unless a lot of people are willing to use up money on it, or we disfigure capitalism. Personally, I'm a firm believer in the second choice, but that's not really supposed to be discussed here. Ohh first things's first, right, got it, understood, will get to it, yep, mhm, mhm, alright one second.

        <h2>The Premise</h2>
    <p>
        Alright, let's do this one last time; The SCP Foundation is a fictional organization which contains & studies anomalous beings, artifacts, events, etc. Although sometimes a baseline "canon" may be referred to, there is none. Different stories have different canons that all are made to fit the story, and this extends to any GoI(Group of Interest) mentioned. Not to be mistaken with "Do whatever just use the title" as there are standards, and consistenly recurring themes. So to break it down: Each SCP story has a required head to use, and the rest of the entire body is as the writer pleases. Do you want the Foundation to be hundreds of years old? Done. Just a decade or so? Done. Is the Foundation extremely very strict about how it works, their motto, and their actions? Only if you need it to be that strict, but don't get it too different the site has rules too and the Foundation has standards. I could go on about what's flexible, or you can do that yourself.

        Alright, so you got the premise. What now, you ask? Ask so I can continue. Thank you. Well now I give you some stuff to remember if you decide to read from there. <strong>Note from future me, I might not even talk about the stories. Ignore the link if you wanna, cause this is gonna be my personal guide from me to you.</strong>

        <h1>A Guide to The Foundation, from Ferris - A barely-below-mid-level reader of the wiki.</h1>

    <br>

        <h2>(General) Ranks of Order</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Administrator - Top of the top of the top. Literally. Created the place, and context of him/her/it/   can be changed, except shrouded in mystery.</li>
        <li>The O5 (Overseer) council - Usually the top of the top. Very mysterious and thus flexible. Usually 13 members, or well 13 numbers. Apparently in some canons multiple people share the number. They may be human, or just be humanoids. They do have anomalous effects as well, that's consistent, but a story can remove that. Sometimes the numbers are a rank of personal order inside the council. You get it, very flexible and mysterious. The 5 in their group name comes from their security level which I'll also get into. Only they may have Level 5 keycards.</li>
        <li>Ethics Committee - Alright, I know, I know. "Dude, this is a division of the Foundation, not a rank." I knowwwwwwuh, buuuut the Head of the Ethics Committee can sometimes be on par with the O5, and the division itself tends to be on par with the O5, as can be inferred by the fact that both groups have their own personal MTF Groups (We'll get into them later but imagine security for these fellas) so these guys count as much as the O5 does.</li>
        <li>Heads of a Division - Come on, there's not much here. Level 4 people who don't need much explanation, you've worked and seen movies of needed delegated jobs before. I think they tend to be on par with Heads of projects and MTF Squad leaders though, but idk I don't work there. <small>as far as you know..</small></li>
        <li>Level 3 staff - Seniors. I'm gonna keep going on the ranks of order, but gonna explain only as needed.</li>
        <li>Level 2 staff - Honestly, I'd mix this with level 1 staff for a short wrap-up but noooo I need to do something else with level 1. Most staff will be this rank.</li>
        <li>Level 1 staff - Newbies, obviously. I know you see what level is after this, so you're asking "Why are these guys newbies if there's a lesser level?" Probably asking. Ask. Now. Thank you. Level 1 staff are not just the newbies, but recurring miscellaneous staff too. A newbie is on the same level as a trusted janitor, despite whatever "big" project a Level 1 is working on.</li>
        <li>Level 0 staff, yes this is an actual level. - Miscellaneous staff. Usually amnesticized after they're done doing whatever they're here for. I mean there for.</li>
    </ul>
