        <h1>Welcome to my[Aidan's/Ferris'] personal file.</h1>
    <br>

    <p>Hello!! I don't reeeaally know what to write about in regards to my self, so I'll write a bit about things I've been reading, and page 2 
        will be a deeper explanation into some of them. Actually, no, I'll just make this page the non-SCP stuff, and also not edit this paragraph;
         keep it a little messy, y'know?
    </p>

        <h2>Realistic Fiction</h2>
    <p>Honestly, one of my lesser favored genres. I like it, but not nearly as much as other things I read. <mark>Of course, this is only generally
        speaking.</mark> I just finished reading up Osamu Dazai's <strong>"The Flowers Of Buffoonery"</strong>, and recommended both it and its sequel, 
        <strong>"No Longer Human"</strong>, to someone I am very close to. Though, what differs between Osamu Dazai is his unknowing relation to
        unrealistic fiction. Bungo Stray Dogs is an animanga series that's been ongoing since ~2012, and features the names and books of numerous
        real, dead authors, excluding one named after a living and modern author. Osamu Dazai, the pen name which he is referred to by, is one of these
        characters, along with his book's name, "No Longer Human".
