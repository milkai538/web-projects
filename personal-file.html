    <h1>Welcome to my [Aidan's/Ferris'] personal file.</h1>

    <br>

    <p>
        Hello!! I don't reeeaally know what to write about in regards to my self, so I'll write a bit about things I've been reading, and page 2 
        will be a deeper explanation into some of them. Actually, no, I'll just make this page the non-SCP stuff, and also not edit this paragraph;
        keep it a little messy and true to the self, y'know?
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Realistic Fiction</h2>

    <p>
        Honestly, one of my lesser favored genres. I like it, but not nearly as much as other things I read. <mark>Of course, this is only generally
        speaking.</mark> I just finished reading up Osamu Dazai's <strong>"The Flowers Of Buffoonery"</strong>, and recommended both it and its sequel, 
        <strong>"No Longer Human"</strong>, to someone I am very close to. Though, what differs between Osamu Dazai is his unknowing relation to
        unrealistic fiction. Bungo Stray Dogs is an animanga series that's been ongoing since ~2012, and features the names and books of numerous
        real, dead authors, excluding one named after a living and modern author. Osamu Dazai, the pen name which he is referred to by, is one of these
        characters, along with his book's name, "No Longer Human".

    <h2>Sci-fi</h2>

    <p>
        WOOOOHOOOOOO SCI-FI IS <sub>usually</sub> AMAZING AGHH, but this <em>isn't</em> <a href="personal-file-2.html">
        the page I'm gonna talk about it on</a>, cause like all of the 
        sci-fi I read is SCP. <del>am I a dork?</del>
    </p>

    <br>

        <h2>Comedy</h2>

    <p>
        I'm gonna be so for real, I've only ever went out of my way to read and watch one series that's mainly comedy, and it's 
        <strong>"The Disasterous Life Of Saiki K".</strong> It's an animanga comedy about this teenager with like almost every superpower ever, but he just
        wants to live a normal life, and also has really <del>weird</del>unique <del>people who follow him</del>friends like: The prettiest woman 
        ever(literally.), a 2nd year (HS grade they're in) who pretends to have superpowers, a guy who canonically does not think, etc. Although
        it's mostly comedy, it still has traits outside of that, and good ones too. Saiki (His name is actually a play on the word psychic, Saiki K
        Saikik you get it) is actually a dynamic character who's growth is actually kinda hard to spot but still noticable, or maybe I'm just not
        too observant. I could talk about this series all day but let's not.

        <h2>Supernatural Fiction</h2>
    
    <p>
        Is also mostly gonna be talked about in SCP, buuut don't worry I have a solution to this.
    </p>
    
    <br>
    
        <h2>Supernatural Fiction AND Action</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>BOOM</strong> problem mostly solved. My favorite combo of genres, especially when the supernatural abilities have deeper explanations, and/or
        a system to them, some exceptions. Let's talk about one of said exceptions: Bungo Stray Dogs is an animanga I've already talked about, buuut
        I didn't mention that the ability a character has is named after one of the books that the authour they're named after had written, with an
        exception of course. The reason it gets an exception for the powers not having any deeper meaning <strong>AS FAR AS I KNOW OF</strong> is because the 
        story is well written if you ignore some plotholes, some weird characters, weird scenes, the refusal to let any character just die; Only 
        like 4 named characters have died from everyone shown, which would be nice if it wasn't trying to be a darker show. A main villain just.. "lost
        the connection between his head and body" (School appropriate don't worry) and I'm still like 60% sure he's gonna be in next month's chapter. 
        Alive. Not only that, the way they <em>finally</em> got rid of him was by sacrificing a different named character. WHO WAS ALREADY SUPPOSED TO
        BE DEAD UGH. I HATE THIS SHOW SOMETIMES. QUIT BEING A COWARD AND KILL SOME CHARACTERS, EXCEPT FOR THAT ROACH OF A MAN WHO SURVIVED SO MANY NEAR 
        DEATH SCENES THAT HE SHOULDNT EVEN SHOW UP IN ANYTHING BUT PREQUELS. LITERALLY CHAPTER 1 HE ALMOST DIES. HE IS NEARLY DEAD IN HIS INTRODUCTION, 
        THAT ROACH, but it's okay cause I love him. Also, before I end this off-topic rant, I want to point out that the main villain had to fight 2 characters 
        who have an ability which would counter his semi-immortality ability, back-to-back, and retains no lasting damage from either of them.
        Jujutsu Kaisen/Kaizen has both a nice power system, <em>and</em> the powers represent a part of the characters; The powers represent their 
        relations with others, but some powers are harder to understand than others in the aspect. For example: The main villain has a cut and slash
        based ability representing his willingness to cut ties and harm others, but one of the side characters has the ability to swap with people and 
        supernatural things by clapping. I believe said side character's ability is meant to represent how much trust is required to share a bond with 
        him, as if you're fighting alongside him and don't trust in his timing then <em>you'll</em> be the one messing each other up, but by relying 
        on him as much as he relies on you would make an unstoppable combo.
