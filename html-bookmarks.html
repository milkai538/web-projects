        <h1>Problems I've had in trying to make my story's skeleton.</h1>

        <h2>Section 1: Reading </h2>

    <p><strong>The necessity to read before writing.</strong></p>

    <p>I have high standards in a ton of things, and feel as if I fail consistenly because I do not meet the standards I make either. Nobody does, but we're not talking about my self-caused self destruction here. I feel that I cannot write this story that includes characters from a series because I haven't read enough about the characters, or the premise, or everything that I will mention. Everything I mention I must read at least a chunk of works about, at least that's how I feel.</p> 


        <section id="section2"></section>
        <h2>Section 2: Characters </h2>

    <p><strong>A continuation of the last section, but more in depth.</strong></p>

    <p>Some of the characters I'll be writing about includes Alto Clef, and his daughter Meri, but I feel like I've read far from enough to have the privilege of writing them into this story. I'm actually currently rereading a backstory for Alto to try and understand him better, and the story.</p> 


        <section id="section3"></section>
        <h2>Section 3: Procrastination </h2>

    <p><strong>The continued choice to not do something despite wanting to</strong></p>

    <p>I've already talked about this a ton before. It's a major problem of mine.</p> 


        <section id="section4"></section>
        <h2>Section 4: Communication </h2>

    <p><strong>Getting my point across</strong></p>

    <p>I think I just gotta suck it up, simplify some stuff, and do what I can. No matter what, there's gonna be complaints about how I communicate the story. It'll be too easy for some, and impossible for a ton. For example: In Jujutsu Kaisen, Sukuna (the primary antagonist) briefly mentions that he had a traumatic upbringing. A portion too big of people, myself included, took this not as a sign of narrative storytelling but a flimsy attempt to make us feel bad for him.</p> 



        <section id="section5"></section>
        <h2>Section 5: Fear </h2>

    <p><strong>I don't wanna seem like a bad storyteller</strong></p>

    <p>I still just need to simply suck it up and do what I can, but I hold writers to high standards and nigh idolize ones that I love. I'm going to put myself to horrifically unfair comparisons, and am scared of getting backlash or nonconstructive criticism.</p>     



        <section id="section6"></section>
        <h2>Section 6: Identity </h2>

    <p><strong>The characters' identity, not mine.</strong></p>

    <p>I still have a general confusion about what exactly I want to do with my characters, especially my main, and I'm scared of miscommunication. I <em>will</em> make my main character transgender, but what if people read it as me being transphobic when part of what the story is about is how it's painful to deny and exclude your identity in order to "fit in" and you should be who you are.</p> 



        <section id="section7"></section>
        <h2>Section 7: Mischaracterization </h2>

    <p><strong>I might release my notes after I conclude the story to prevent this.</strong></p>

    <p>My protagonist is gonna be transgender. That is a fact that I will not back down on. I'm going to use that exact terminology as well, but what if people take it wrong? She's gonna be violent, and go through a ton of traumatic things (a portion of so being caused by her) and people might read it as a transphobic message, or take it as "do this and that" when I mean "consider that and this, please." I'll put it blatantly: She's gonna kill people. tons. People might read that as, and I don't agree with this, "You can kill people and it's okay if you just come out as trans." NO!!! She's gonna be tormented by her actions until the day her death is a constant fact!! But she's not gonna let it stop her from living!! She's gonna repent by helping people!!</p> 



        <section id="section8"></section>
        <h2>Section 8: Rookie mistakes </h2>

    <p><strong>Did I mention that this is my first story?</strong></p>

    <p>Yeah, you read that right. This will be my first ever written and released story, and I don't even have any help from people who have done this before. I'm gonna make mistakes, and am scared that my story will be discredited for them. Worse though, people might get the same expecations of me as I put onto my own idolized writers.</p> 


    
        <section id="section9"></section>
        <h2>Section 9: The Incident. </h2>

    <p><strong>I won't say too much here.</strong></p>

    <p>Let's be brief. You know Slenderman. You know the tragedy. I don't want that to happen with my characters. Thank god for the girl being safe as of current, and may the attempted killers repent, and try making up for it for life.</p> 


    
      <section id="section10"></section>
        <h2>Section 10: Me, the author</h2>

    <p><strong>Fans and I directly</strong></p>

    <p>If it gets even somewhat popular people are gonna try and learn more about me. I actually might know the stories bones of a few chapters better than myself. I hate expectations. Don't expect anything of me, but don't get <em>too</em> surprised when I do something wonderful. Have the right idea about me without ever knowing me, and make pigs fly while you're at it.</p>
