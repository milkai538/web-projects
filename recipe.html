        <h1>A Quick Hummus Recipe</h1>
    <p>Hummus is a thick paste commonly paired with salads, grilled meats, pita breads,
    and other Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. This recipe I learned from numerous different recipes over 
    the years will teach you how to quickly make some of the tasty hummus with as little mess as possible.</p>

<br>

        <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>One can (400g) of</em> chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li><em>175g of</em> tahini</li>
        <li><em>Six</em> sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li><em>Half of a</em> red pepper</li>
        <li><em>A pinch of</em> cayenne pepper</li>
        <li><em>One clove of</em> garlic</li>
        <li><em>A dash of</em> olive oil</li>
    </ul>

<br>

        <h2>What You're Here For</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by removing the skin from the garlic, and chop it coarsely</li>
        <li>Remove all of the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Add all of the ingredients into a food processor</li>
        <li>Process all of the ingredients into a paste</li>
        <li><mark>If you want a coarse, and "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</mark></li>
        <li><mark>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</mark></li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you'd prefer different flavors, try blending in a <em>small measure</em> of <strong>lemon and coriander, 
    chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese.</strong> Experiment and see what works best for you!!
    Don't forget to store it!!</p>

<br>

        <h2>How To Store It</h2>
    <p>Once you finish using your tasty hummus, seal the leftovers in a good container! You should be able to use
    it for just around a week after you've made it, but throw it out if it starts getting all fizzy. Hummus <em>can</em>
    be frozen, but you gotta remember to thaw it and use it within a couple of months!</p>
