    <br>
    
    <p>A couple genres I'm fond of <b>in no particular order</b> with examples</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>sci-fi</dt>
             <dd>Just about everything in the SCP wiki</dd>
        
        <dt>Supernatural/Fiction</dt>
             <dd>So many examples, because I almost purely read things that have the supernatural. I'll read realistic fiction, but I'll usually only be interested if it's unrealistic.</dd>
        
        <dt>actionnnn in graphic novels and similar things!! <big>RAHHHHHHH</big> <del>but only if they go beyond just repetitive fighting here have some examples</del></dt>
             <dd>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Bleach, and JJK all have abilities that represent a part of the self</dd>

            <ul>
                <li>If you were to ask me my favorite series, 10/10 times the answer would be Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. I could go on about this series, and name things I like about it. It's weird, it's awesome, blah blah blah you've heard it all before. But have you heard that it's in the Louvre?</li>
